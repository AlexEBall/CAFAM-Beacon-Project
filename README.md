# CAFAM-Beacon-Project

Working with the wonderful pepole at [The Craft and Folk Art Museum](http://www.cafam.org/) was a great experience. My team provisioned some [Estimote](https://estimote.com/) Beacons and placed them around the musuem to test the power of the physical web. 

### Requirements 

In order for the BLE technology to transmit from the beacons to phones, one needs to turn on their bluetooth and location. We set signs up around the street to let pedestrians known about the event that night.

## Layout 
### Entrance

One beacon was placed near the enterance of the museum and was pushing a flyer url from the hours of 11am to 5pm, letting people know about the event later that night.
