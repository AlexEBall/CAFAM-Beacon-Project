# CAFAM-Beacon-Project

Working with the wonderful pepole in The Craft and Folk Art Museum was a great experience. My team provisioned some Estimote Beacons and placed them around the musuem to test the power of the physical web. 

### Requirements 

In order for the BLE technology to transmit from the beacons to phones, one needs to turn on their bluetooth and location. We set signs up around the street to let pedestrians known about the event that night.
